The trajectory details the continued development of the TransportDF ride-sharing app. Initially, the AI engineer focused on delivering completed driver and admin dashboard files, while successfully implementing a chat system between passengers and drivers using a polling mechanism and integrating it into both user dashboards and the admin interface. Backend modifications were made to support chat and richer user data.

Mid-trajectory, the user reported a critical bug in the passenger dashboard: a rating popup repeatedly blocked the screen. The AI swiftly diagnosed the issue, identifying the incorrect use of  in a React Native environment and a flawed trip rating verification logic. The fix involved migrating to  for persistence, introducing a  state, refining the  function to accurately track evaluated trips, and adding a Skip Rating option to improve UX. The AI then delivered the corrected passenger dashboard and the admin dashboard files. The last explicit request for final dashboard code was met.

<product_requirements>
The Transport App Brasília MVP is a ride-sharing application for Android/iOS, simulating Uber's core functionalities including user (passenger, driver, admin) registration/login, blocking, trip management (request, tracking, acceptance, completion), reporting, and 5-star post-trip rating. Admin features encompass report viewing, driver alerts, user/trip management, bulk deletion, and direct passenger messaging. Recent enhancements involved profile photo upload for all user types, with dashboards displaying these and allowing full-screen viewing. The primary focus of the analyzed work was to implement a real-time, polling-based chat system between passengers and drivers for active trips, with a 250-character limit. The admin dashboard was required to log these chats and display comprehensive passenger/driver details (photo, name, email, contact) alongside trip routes and statuses. A critical bug fix was also addressed, where the passenger rating popup was persistently re-appearing after already being completed.

<code_architecture>

- ****: Central FastAPI application.
    - **Importance**: Handles all API logic, database interactions, and authentication.
    - **Changes Made**: Extended  model, added  Pydantic model. New API endpoints: , . Modified  to include full passenger/driver details.
- ****: Admin control panel.
    - **Importance**: Provides administrative oversight, including user, trip, and report management.
    - **Changes Made**: New Chat M/P tab added for chat monitoring. Enhanced trip data display to include detailed passenger/driver info. This file was delivered as .
- ****: Passenger interface.
    - **Importance**: Core screen for passengers to request/manage trips and view profile.
    - **Changes Made**: Integrated . Added states (, , ). Crucially,  logic was revised to use  (instead of ) and a  state to prevent the recurring rating modal. A Skip Rating button was added. This file was delivered as .
- ****: Driver interface.
    - **Importance**: Core screen for drivers to accept/manage trips and view profile.
    - **Changes Made**: Integrated . New states for chat functionality. A Chat button was added to the . This file was created as .
- ** (New file)**: Reusable React Native component.
    - **Importance**: Encapsulates the chat UI and logic, including message display, input with character limit, and API integration for sending/fetching messages (polling).

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate fully with Google Maps API for accurate distance matrix, routing, and real-time map display.
- Implement an advanced payment system (e.g., Stripe, PagSeguro).
- Expand geographical coverage beyond Brasília/DF.
- Add push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).
- Develop detailed KYC and background check processes for drivers.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and integrated a polling-based chat system for passengers and drivers, with an administrative monitoring tab. The backend was verified to support these features. The user then reported a critical bug in the  where the trip rating popup would reappear persistently after refreshing the screen, even if already completed. The AI diagnosed this as an issue with incorrect use of  (not suitable for React Native) and flawed logic in .

The AI applied a fix by:
1.  Migrating the persistence of rated trip IDs from  to .
2.  Introducing a  state (a ) to accurately track trips a passenger has already rated or skipped.
3.  Modifying  and  to correctly check .
4.  Adding a  function and a Pular Avaliação (Skip Rating) button to the rating modal, allowing users to dismiss the modal without providing a rating, while still marking the trip as 'seen' in .
5.  Adjusting related styles.

After these fixes, the AI restarted the frontend and provided a detailed summary of the implemented corrections. Finally, the AI delivered the complete, adjusted  and  files, fulfilling the user's explicit request.

<optional_next_step>
The last explicit user request was fulfilled. The next step is to ask the user what they want to work on next, perhaps from the broader pending tasks.
