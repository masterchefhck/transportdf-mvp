The trajectory outlines the application's development from a rudimentary state to a feature-rich ride-sharing platform. Initial phases involved restoring core functionalities, such as a polling-based chat and enhanced user dashboards. A significant portion of the work focused on refining location-based features, evolving from a mock Google Maps implementation to a full integration of the Google Maps SDK. Key challenges included troubleshooting web compatibility for autocomplete, resolving Expo SDK version mismatches (upgrading to SDK 54), and debugging network configuration issues when the user ran a local frontend connecting to a remote backend. The AI systematically addressed user feedback, iterating from basic address validation to a sophisticated Uber/99-style interactive map with real-time autocomplete and routing. The continuous back-and-forth between user reports and AI-driven fixes, often involving concurrent frontend and backend adjustments, highlights an adaptive development process.

<product_requirements>
The Transport App Brasília MVP is a ride-sharing mobile application for Android/iOS, supporting passenger, driver, and admin roles. Core functionalities include user registration/login, trip management (request, tracking, acceptance, completion), post-trip 5-star rating, and reporting. Admin features involve report viewing, driver alerts, user/trip management, bulk data deletion, and direct passenger messaging. Profile photo uploads are supported.

Past requirements included re-implementing a polling-based chat (5-second interval, 250-char limit), displaying photo, name, and rating of passenger/driver in trip listings/current trip views, real-time synchronization via polling, adjusting passenger rating UI, adding trip history, enhancing admin trip details, implementing Forgot Password with email/CPF validation, new message alerts for chat, replacing Procurando motorista with an animated progress bar, and showing CPF/phone in Admin Users tab with clickable names.

The most recent and active requirement is to implement a professional, interactive Google Maps-based trip request system, similar to Uber/99. This involves automatically using the user's current location as the origin, providing a single destination input field with dynamic Google Places autocomplete suggestions, and rendering an interactive map that visualizes the origin, selected destination, and the calculated route with an estimated price. This requires integration of the actual Google Maps SDK using an API Key.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with an Expo React Native frontend, a FastAPI Python backend, and a MongoDB database. Frontend navigation uses Expo Router's file-based routing.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central API for auth, user/trip/report/rating management, admin operations, and database interaction. It was initially updated with mock Google Maps API endpoints (, , ) which were later refined for more flexible address handling.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Expo project configuration, including SDK version, plugins, and native configurations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to target Expo SDK 54.0.0. Crucially,  was added under  and  to enable the native Google Maps SDK.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Dependencies were upgraded to be compatible with Expo SDK 54.0.0. Specifically, , , , and  were added or updated.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main dashboard screen for passengers.
    -   **Changes Made**: Underwent significant iterations for trip request functionality. It evolved from a manual address input, to an Uber/99-style local autocomplete (which was problematic on web and still required explicit destination selection), and is now being updated to integrate the new  component via a , effectively replacing the previous trip request UI and logic.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provided a basic, non-interactive map for displaying trip routes and markers during the initial mock Google Maps integration phase.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and later augmented with fallback rendering methods (e.g., plain s) to address potential  rendering issues, although its role is now being fully superseded by .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A custom React hook designed to abstract interactions with the mock Google Maps backend endpoints.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to encapsulate API calls for directions, geocoding, reverse geocoding, and price calculation. A critical fix involved changing the API URL source from  to  for correct environment variable access.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Renders a map specific to displaying an active trip's details.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to utilize  and the  hook to show trip origin, destination, and route for active trips.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is a newly created component that provides the full interactive Google Maps experience for trip requests.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implements  from , integrates  for current user position, and uses  for destination search with real Google Places API. It handles map interactions, displays markers for origin/destination, draws routes using polylines, and estimates trip prices.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate an advanced payment system (e.g., Stripe, PagSeguro).
-   Expand geographical coverage beyond Brasília/DF.
-   Add push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).
-   Develop detailed KYC and background check processes for drivers.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing the real Google Maps SDK to replace the previous mock and local autocomplete-based trip request system in the passenger application. The user provided the Google Maps API Key.

The current work involved:
1.  **Local Environment Setup Instructions**: The AI provided instructions for the user to update their local  with the  and to install necessary packages (, , ).
2.  ** Configuration**: Instructions were given to update the local  to include the  under the  and  sections, crucial for native Google Maps integration.
3.  ** Creation**: A new file, , was created. This component is designed to be a full-screen, interactive map where passengers can see their current location, search for a destination using Google Places Autocomplete, visualize the route, and get an estimated price.
4.  ** Integration**: The AI has provided a complete, updated version of  (Chat Message 248). This updated file imports the new  component and integrates it into a . The old  state and associated logic for the text-based trip request form (with local autocomplete and quick destinations) have been removed or commented out. The Solicitar Viagem button now triggers the display of the  modal. A placeholder function  is included to process trip details received from .

The current state is that the  has been modified and provided to the user. The expectation is for the user to apply these changes locally, restart their Expo project, and then test the new real Google Maps-based trip request interface.
