This trajectory details the seamless transition of a ride-sharing MVP, TransportDF, from an AI engineer to myself. The initial phase focused on restoring the codebase to a stable, pre-error state after the previous AI's SkyCab renaming efforts led to a broken admin dashboard. I diligently re-integrated original , , , and  files, ensuring the application reverted to Transport App Brasília MVP as per user instruction. Post-restoration, the system successfully passed initial frontend tests. Subsequently, I implemented two key enhancements to the driver dashboard: real-time rating display and an Ok, entendido button for alerts, which involved both backend and frontend modifications. The project concluded with a new, multi-faceted user request focusing on passenger dashboard rating display, admin-to-passenger messaging, and comprehensive bulk deletion capabilities across the admin panel, which I've begun to address with initial backend updates.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to build a ride-sharing MVP named TransportDF (later briefly SkyCab, then reverted to Transport App Brasília MVP) for Brasília/DF, targeting Android and iOS, similar to Uber/99. Key features included passenger registration, trip requests, and tracking; driver registration, online/offline toggling, and trip management; and an admin dashboard for system oversight.

The user's explicit requests and implemented features evolved:
1.  **Backend Setup**: Resolution of  and  environment issues.
2.  **Frontend Accessibility**: Dedicated login pages for passenger, driver, and admin, and cross-platform UI for alerts (, ).
3.  **Reporting System**: Passengers report drivers, drivers report passengers (title, description).
4.  **Admin Management**: View all reports, send messages (one response allowed), block/unblock users.
5.  **Passenger Quick Actions**: Activate Histórico, Pagamento, and Ajuda buttons with placeholder alerts.
6.  **Rating System**: 5-star rating for passengers to rate drivers post-trip (mandatory reason for < 5 stars, resets every 100 trips).
7.  **Admin Rating Management**: Avaliações de Motoristas tab for ratings < 5, sending alerts to drivers (no response needed).
8.  **Driver Alert Display**: Drivers view admin alerts.
9.  **Admin Alert Button State**: Enviar Alerta button disabled/grayed out if alert already sent.
10. **Project Renaming**: Initially to SkyCab, then reverted to Transport App Brasília MVP due to issues.
11. **Driver Dashboard Enhancements (Recently Implemented)**:
    *   Display driver's real-time rating, dynamically synchronized.
    *   Add Ok, entendido button for driver alerts to mark them as read.
12. **Pending Enhancements (Currently Being Worked On)**:
    *   Passenger dashboard: Display rating and read admin messages.
    *   Admin dashboard: Add Mensagem para Passageiro menu item, allowing selection of passengers for direct messaging.
    *   Admin dashboard: Implement bulk deletion for trips, users, reports, and ratings.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing), AsyncStorage, axios, expo-location,  (cross-platform UI), Ionicons (icons).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient), JWT (authentication), Pydantic (data models), , .
-   **Core Features**: User authentication/authorization, real-time location tracking, comprehensive trip lifecycle management, user/report/rating/admin message/alert management, user blocking/unblocking.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with an Expo React Native frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. The project is organized into  and  directories.



-   ****: The core FastAPI application, handling API endpoints for all user types. It defines Pydantic models for users, trips, reports, ratings, and admin alerts. It connects to MongoDB and manages JWT authentication.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        *   **Restoration**: Reverted to Transport App Brasília MVP for app title, health check, and JWT secret key.
        *   **Driver Dashboard Enhancements**:
            *   Added  to  model to track if an alert has been seen.
            *   Modified  to include the  status.
            *   Added new endpoint  to allow drivers to mark specific alerts as read.
            *    endpoint to fetch a user's current average rating.
        *   **Upcoming Changes (Backend Phase 1)**: Initial steps to add endpoints for:
            *   Admin-to-passenger messages.
            *   Bulk deletion of trips, users, reports, and ratings.
-   ****: The administrative control panel, displaying statistics, users, trips, reports, and low ratings.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        *   **Restoration**: Reverted to original  code, restoring the initial state of the admin dashboard which was previously reported as messed up. This includes tabs for 'stats', 'users', 'trips', 'reports', 'ratings'. It supports messaging, blocking/unblocking users, and sending alerts for low ratings with a disabled state for already sent alerts.
-   ****: The main interface for passengers, supporting trip requests, report submission, and viewing responses to reports.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        *   **Restoration**: Reverted to original  code. It includes trip request/tracking, reporting drivers, viewing/responding to reports against the passenger, quick action buttons, and a post-trip rating modal.
-   ****: The main interface for drivers, managing online/offline status, available trips, and current trips.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        *   **Restoration**: Reverted to original  code, restoring functionality for status toggling, trip acceptance, starting, and completion, and reporting passengers.
        *   **Driver Dashboard Enhancements**:
            *   Introduced  state to display the driver's average rating.
            *   Implemented  function to fetch the rating from the backend.
            *    updated to load  on component mount.
            *    function updated to reload  after a trip is finalized.
            *   Rating displayed prominently in the header area.
            *    function implemented to call the new backend endpoint.
            *   Alert notification badge now filters to show only unread alerts.
            *   Added an Ok, entendido button within the alert modal to mark individual alerts as read.
            *   Introduced new CSS styles to support the rating display and alert button.
-   ****: The root of the Expo Router application.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: No direct edits in the current trajectory, but it was noted in the initial setup description that it was refactored to redirect to type-specific logins and the app title was updated to SkyCab, which was then implicitly reverted to TransportDF during the general code restoration.
-   ****: Stores . No changes to the content, but its role in API calls is critical.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the user provided a new set of requirements for further enhancements. The current focus is on implementing these, starting with backend modifications. I have already begun this by updating  to support these new features. Specifically, I have made initial modifications to the  file to include:

1.  **New endpoints for sending messages from the admin to specific passengers.** This involves creating the necessary data models and API routes for this communication.
2.  **New endpoints to handle the bulk deletion of various data entities.** This includes enabling the deletion of one or more selected trips, users, reports, and ratings, which requires careful implementation to ensure data integrity and proper authorization.

These backend changes are the foundational step for the new functionalities requested for the passenger and admin dashboards. I have successfully written the initial backend code snippets in  in three separate tool calls (Chat 72, 74, 76), and the next step is to proceed with the frontend updates for the passenger dashboard.

<optional_next_step>
I will now update the passenger dashboard to implement the rating display and admin message reading functionality.
