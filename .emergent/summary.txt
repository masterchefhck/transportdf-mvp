<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully executed the task of building an MVP for a ride-sharing application named TransportDF for Brasília/DF, similar to Uber/99. The initial phase involved extensive requirements gathering and detailed planning, covering hardware, software, services, and core functionalities. The user opted for an MVP focus, which the AI then meticulously implemented.

The development workflow was iterative: planning, dependency installation, backend development (FastAPI with MongoDB), then frontend development (Expo React Native) for three distinct user types (Passenger, Driver, Admin). Authentication, real-time location updates, trip request/acceptance/completion, and basic admin dashboards were implemented. The AI demonstrated good problem-solving by correcting AsyncStorage issues and providing comprehensive testing instructions. The final phase involved packaging and delivering all source code files, along with setup guides, to the user, ensuring the project is ready for local deployment and testing. The AI addressed user's specific request to get all files in an organized manner, finally delivering them one by one.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a ride-sharing application similar to Uber/99, targeting both Android and iOS platforms, with an initial focus on Brazil for viagens (travels/trips). The AI engineer refined this into an MVP for Brasília/DF.

The core product features for the MVP include:
*   **Passenger App:** User registration/login (CPF, phone), interactive map with current location, define origin/destination, estimated price calculation, trip request, real-time driver tracking, trip finalization, and basic payment options (PIX/Cash).
*   **Driver App:** Driver registration (including documents), online/offline toggle, receiving/accepting/rejecting ride requests, integrated GPS navigation, initiating/finalizing trips, and managing earnings.
*   **Admin Panel (Web/App):** Dashboard with analytics, user/driver management, real-time trip monitoring, and basic reporting.

The application is built with a responsive UI, ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Essential external services were identified, including Google Maps Platform for geolocation and Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications (though not fully integrated in MVP). Payment integration was planned for Stripe, PagSeguro, and PIX. The MVP focuses on fundamental ride-sharing mechanics and user authentication.

- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing), @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, expo-location, axios for API calls.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (AsyncIOMotorClient), JWT (PyJWT, passlib, bcrypt) for authentication, python-dotenv for environment variables, geopy/haversine for distance calculation.
- **State Management**: React's useState/useEffect, AsyncStorage for persistence.
- **UI/UX**: React Native components, SafeAreaView, Ionicons from @expo/vector-icons.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture: a React Native frontend built with Expo, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. The project is structured with separate  and  directories.



-   ****: Specifies Python dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn, pymongo, pydantic, pyjwt, passlib, bcrypt, geopy, haversine, etc.) required for the backend server.
-   ****: Configuration file containing sensitive environment variables like  and  for MongoDB connection.
-   ****: The core FastAPI application. It defines data models (User, Trip, LocationUpdate, etc.) using Pydantic, implements JWT-based authentication (register, login, token creation), and provides RESTful API endpoints for user management (profile, location updates, driver status), trip management (request, available, accept, start, complete, fetch user-specific trips), and administrative functions (get all users, all trips, and statistics). It includes utility functions for password hashing, token creation, and geographical calculations (distance, price).
-   ****: Stores environment variables for the frontend, specifically , which points to the FastAPI backend.
-   ****: Expo configuration file. Contains metadata (name, slug, version), UI settings (orientation, icon, splash screen), platform-specific configurations (iOS/Android), and plugin declarations for  and  (including user permission messages).
-   ****: Lists all Node.js and React Native dependencies for the Expo frontend (e.g.,

-   ****: The main entry point and initial screen for the mobile application. It checks for an existing user session, displays options to select a user mode (Passenger, Driver, Admin), and navigates to either the login screen or the respective dashboard based on the session status. It also includes a logout function.
-   ****: Handles user login for all roles. It takes email and password, authenticates with the backend API, stores the received JWT token and user data in , and redirects to the appropriate dashboard (, , or ) based on the logged-in user's type.
-   ****: Provides user registration functionality. It captures user details like name, email, phone, CPF, and password. It includes basic validation and formatting for CPF and phone numbers, sends the data to the backend for registration, and on success, logs the user in and redirects them to their dashboard.
-   ****: The main interface for passengers. It displays the current location, allows passengers to request a trip by entering pickup and destination addresses (with simulated price estimation for MVP), tracks the status of current trips, and offers quick access to trip history, payment, and help. It requests and uses foreground location permissions.
-   ****: The primary screen for drivers. It features a toggle for online/offline status, displays available trip requests, allows drivers to accept, start, and complete trips, and shows the status of their current active trip. It also handles location updates for the driver.
-   ****: The administrative panel, accessible via the web or mobile. It presents key statistics (total users, drivers, passengers, trips, completion rate), lists all registered users, and shows recent trip activities. It uses a tabbed interface to switch between Estatísticas (Statistics), Usuários (Users), and Viagens (Trips) views.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has completed the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the TransportDF application. This includes the full backend API in Python using FastAPI with MongoDB for data storage, and the complete frontend mobile application developed with Expo React Native.

Specifically, the current state of the product involves:
*   **Backend**: A fully functional FastAPI server () that handles user authentication (register/login with JWT), user data management (including location and driver status updates), trip lifecycle management (request, accept, start, complete), and admin functionalities (fetching users, trips, and statistics). All 21 backend tests passed successfully.
*   **Frontend**: An Expo application with file-based routing providing three distinct user experiences:
    *   **Main Screen ()**: Allows selection between Passenger, Driver, and Admin modes, and handles user session checks.
    *   **Authentication (, )**: Secure login and registration flows for all user types, integrating with the backend API and using  for session management.
    *   **Passenger Dashboard ()**: Enables trip requests (with simulated coordinates for destination in MVP), displays current trip status, and utilizes  for obtaining the passenger's current location.
    *   **Driver Dashboard ()**: Allows drivers to toggle their online status, view and accept available trip requests, and manage the progress of an accepted trip (start/complete). It also updates the driver's location.
    *   **Admin Dashboard ()**: Provides an overview of the system with statistics (total users, drivers, trips) and lists of users and recent trips, organized into navigable tabs.

The code for all these components, along with configuration files (, , ), has been delivered to the user as individual files, organized into  and  directories. The AI also provided a  script to create the basic directory structure and configuration files on a Windows server, and detailed instructions for setting up and testing the application locally.
