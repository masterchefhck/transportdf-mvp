This trajectory chronicles the development of the TransportDF ride-sharing MVP. It began with clarifying the scope and the user's explicit request to focus on passenger profile photo upload. The AI engineer successfully implemented photo upload functionality for both passenger and driver dashboards, including avatar clickability, image selection, and base64 upload to the backend. It also integrated driver information (photo, name, rating) into the passenger dashboard and ensured passenger information (photo, name, rating) was consistently visible in the driver's current trip view. Crucially, photo maximization modals were added to both passenger and driver dashboards, mirroring the admin dashboard's functionality. A significant portion of the conversation involved debugging frontend loading issues and correcting the server port, ultimately resolving connection problems. The trajectory concludes with the user providing an updated driver dashboard code for future use.

<product_requirements>
The Transport App Brasília MVP is a ride-sharing application for Android/iOS, mimicking Uber. Key features include user management (passenger, driver, admin registration/login, blocking), trip management (requests, tracking, acceptance, completion), a reporting system for passengers/drivers, and a 5-star post-trip rating system for drivers (with mandatory reasons for low ratings). Admin features include viewing reports, sending alerts to drivers for low ratings, and managing users/trips. Initial enhancements focused on driver dashboard rating display and alert acknowledgment, admin bulk deletion and direct passenger messaging, and passenger dashboard user rating and admin message display. More recently, profile photo upload for passengers and drivers was added, along with admin dashboard display of user photos and clickable popups for enlarged viewing. The system now supports displaying driver/passenger photos and ratings dynamically across relevant dashboards.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Central FastAPI application managing API endpoints, data models, MongoDB interactions, and JWT authentication.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial restoration and addition of  to , ,  model, admin messaging endpoints,  and bulk delete endpoints. Later,  was added to  model,  for photo upload. Crucially,  was modified to include passenger's photo/rating, and  for passengers and drivers was enhanced to include driver/passenger details respectively (photo, name, rating).
-   ****: Admin control panel for system oversight.
    -   **Changes Made**: Restored to original state with tabs, messaging, blocking, alerts. Added bulk selection/deletion features. Added  to  interface,  states and  for clickable photo thumbnails and a full-screen photo viewer modal (300x400px).
-   ****: Passenger interface for trip requests, reports, admin messages.
    -   **Changes Made**: Restored to original, added  display, admin message fetching/display with notifications.  added to  interface.  installed, and / for avatar-based photo upload.  now fetches .  interface updated for , , . A new Driver Info Section was added to  to display driver details. Photo maximization modal functionality (states, , clickable avatar) was added.
-   ****: Driver interface for status, trips, reports.
    -   **Changes Made**: Restored to original, added  display, .  added to  interface.  installed, and / for driver's own photo upload.  interface updated for , , .  now displays passenger's photo/rating. A Passenger Info Section was added to  to display passenger details throughout the trip lifecycle. Photo maximization modal functionality (states, , clickable passenger photos) was added. The entire file was recently replaced by the user's provided version.

<pending_tasks>
-   Integrate fully with Google Maps API for accurate distance matrix, routing, and real-time map display.
-   Implement an advanced payment system (e.g., Stripe, PagSegurop).
-   Expand geographical coverage beyond Brasília/DF.
-   Implement real-time features like chat and live updates using WebSockets/Socket.io.
-   Add push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).
-   Develop detailed KYC and background check processes for drivers.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed implementing photo maximization for profile pictures across both the passenger and driver dashboards. This involved adding , , and  states, along with a  function to open a full-screen modal (300x400px) displaying the selected photo with the user's name.

For the **Passenger Dashboard ()**, the passenger's own profile photo (from the clickable avatar) and the driver's profile photo (displayed when a trip is accepted) are now clickable to trigger this maximization modal.

For the **Driver Dashboard ()**, the driver's own profile photo (from the clickable avatar) and the passenger's profile photo (displayed in available trip cards and the current trip section) are now clickable for maximization. This ensures that driver's can view passenger photos and vice-versa, similar to the admin functionality.

Before this, the AI also resolved a critical issue where passenger information (name, rating, photo) was disappearing from the driver's current trip view after a trip was accepted/started. This was fixed by modifying the backend's  endpoint to consistently include passenger details for drivers, and updating the driver frontend to display this information in the .

The previous interactions also involved debugging frontend loading issues related to incorrect port usage (initially using 3000 instead of 8081) and Expo tunnel/CI modes, which were resolved by using  directly and cleaning caches.

The very last action in the trajectory was the user providing a new, complete  file, requesting it be used as the definitive version for all future adjustments, which the AI acknowledged.
