The trajectory chronicles the transition of an application from initial AI development to user-guided refinement. Initially, the user replaced the entire codebase with clean and functional versions, leading to the removal of the previously implemented chat system. Subsequent interactions focused on re-implementing crucial features and fixing reported bugs. Key phases included re-introducing a polling-based chat system, enhancing dashboard user information (photos, ratings), implementing real-time synchronization, and adding trip history. Numerous bugs were addressed: a persistent rating modal loop, missing user data in dashboards, non-functional chat input, and UI inconsistencies like the FlatList is not defined error. The final phase concentrated on refining UI elements like chat notifications and a progressive loading bar, and critical bug fixes for password reset and detailed admin user views. The AI consistently used a read-then-edit approach, often performing backend and frontend changes concurrently, and confirmed status after each significant modification.

<product_requirements>
The Transport App Brasília MVP is a ride-sharing mobile application for Android/iOS, supporting passenger, driver, and admin roles. Core functionalities include user registration/login, trip management (request, tracking, acceptance, completion), post-trip 5-star rating, and reporting. Admin features involve report viewing, driver alerts, user/trip management, bulk data deletion, and direct passenger messaging. Profile photo uploads are supported.

Initial AI work included a polling-based chat, but this was removed with user-provided codebase replacements. Bugs needing resolution included a persistent passenger rating modal, a  error, and  issues in the admin dashboard. The user provided clean code to resolve these, aiming for a stable foundation.

Subsequent requirements included:
- Re-implementing a polling-based chat (5-second interval, 250-char limit) between driver/passenger on active trips, with admin history.
- Displaying photo, name, and rating of passenger/driver in trip listings/current trip views on dashboards, with clickable photos.
- Implementing real-time synchronization via polling across all dashboards.
- Adjusting passenger rating UI to be below location.
- Adding trip history for both passenger (value paid, dates, times, destination, driver info) and driver (value received, dates, times, destination).
- Enhancing admin trip details with passenger/driver name, photo, and phone.
- Implementing a Forgot Password feature with email/CPF validation.
- Adding new message alerts for chat.
- Replacing Procurando motorista button with an animated progress bar.
- Admin Users tab to show CPF and phone, with clickable chat names to highlight users.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several bugs and adjustments reported by the user. The primary focus was on solidifying the features that had been recently re-implemented or introduced.

Specifically, the work included:
1.  **Bug in Password Reset:** The backend endpoint ( in ) was corrected to properly hash and store the new password in the database, ensuring that users could log in with their newly set password.
2.  **Forgot Password UI Text:** The text Voltar para validação on the  screen was changed to Voltar para Login and updated to navigate back to .
3.  **Admin Dashboard User Details:** The  function in  was modified to display both the CPF and phone number for each user. Associated styles (, ) were added for visual differentiation.
4.  **Admin Chat P/M Interactivity:** In , user names within the CHAT P/M tab () were made clickable. Clicking a name now switches to the Usuários tab and temporarily highlights (in green) the corresponding user's card in the list for 3 seconds, enhancing discoverability.
5.  **Chat Notification Bug:** The issue where New! chat notifications were not appearing on driver and passenger dashboards when the chat modal was closed was addressed. A new  function was implemented in  and  to run independently (likely through the existing polling mechanism) and update the  state, ensuring visual alerts appear correctly.

All these corrections were tested, and the system reported 15/15 tests passing, indicating a stable state.
