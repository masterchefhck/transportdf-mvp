The previous AI engineer diligently built a ride-sharing MVP, TransportDF, later renamed SkyCab. The initial phase tackled environment setup with Docker for MongoDB and Uvicorn, and resolved cross-platform UI issues, specifically for alerts. Core features like a comprehensive reporting and user blocking system were implemented across the backend and all three dashboards (admin, driver, passenger). This involved new API endpoints, UI elements, and complex logic for report creation, admin intervention, and user responses. Passenger quick action buttons were also made functional. A significant recent addition was a 5-star rating system, allowing passengers to rate drivers post-trip, requiring a reason for low ratings. The admin dashboard gained a dedicated tab to manage these low ratings and send alerts to drivers. Drivers were also equipped to receive and view these admin alerts. The project's name change to SkyCab was executed across key files. However, the trajectory concludes with the user reporting that the admin dashboard is now messed up and gave an error after these updates, indicating a critical stability issue that requires immediate attention, potentially by reintegrating user-provided original code.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a ride-sharing application, TransportDF (later renamed SkyCab), similar to Uber/99, for Brasília/DF, targeting Android and iOS. The MVP's core features included:
*   **Passenger**: Registration, interactive map, trip request, tracking.
*   **Driver**: Registration, online/offline toggle, trip management.
*   **Admin**: Dashboard for system oversight, user, and trip monitoring.

User requests evolved to include:
1.  **Backend Setup**: Resolve environment issues related to  and .
2.  **Frontend Accessibility**: Ensure web accessibility and dedicated login pages for each user type (, , ).
3.  **Cross-Platform UI**: Replace  with cross-platform  and . Implement correct logout redirection to respective login pages.
4.  **Reporting System**: Enable passengers to report drivers and drivers to report passengers, including title and description.
5.  **Admin Management**: View all reports on the admin dashboard, send messages to reported users (one response allowed), and block/unblock users.
6.  **Passenger Dashboard Quick Actions**: Activate Histórico, Pagamento, and Ajuda buttons with placeholder functionalities.
7.  **Rating System**: Implement a 5-star rating system (1-5, initial 5.0, resets every 100 trips) for passengers to rate drivers post-trip. For ratings below 5 stars, a motivo (reason) field is mandatory.
8.  **Admin Rating Management**: Add an Avaliações de Motoristas tab to the admin dashboard, showing only ratings below 5 stars with their reasons. Admins should be able to send alerts to drivers with low ratings without requiring a response.
9.  **Driver Alert Display**: Drivers must be able to view alerts sent by administrators.
10. **Admin Alert Button State**: The Enviar Alerta button on the admin dashboard should be disabled and display Alerta Enviado (in light gray) if an alert for that specific rating has already been sent.
11. **Project Renaming**: Change the project name from TransportDF to SkyCab across the application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the project renaming from TransportDF to SkyCab, updating relevant strings in  (FastAPI title, health check, JWT secret),  (main title),  (app name, slug, scheme), and  (project name).

Following the renaming, the user identified a critical omission in the  file provided by the AI: the  property for the  plugin was missing. The AI corrected this by referencing an original backup file and re-integrating the complete  configuration while retaining the SkyCab name.

The most recent development is a report from the user stating that a dashboard do admin ficou toda bagunçada e deu erro (the admin dashboard is all messed up and gave an error) upon refreshing the page. This indicates a significant regression or bug, potentially introduced during the recent renaming, the  correction, or interactions with the newly implemented rating/alert system. The user has offered to provide the original code files for replacement to help resolve this issue, implying a need for careful diagnosis and potentially partial or full rollback/reintegration.
