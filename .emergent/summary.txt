<analysis>
This trajectory details the continued development of the TransportDF ride-sharing app. It began with the user providing an updated  file, which the AI engineer successfully replaced and verified, ensuring all previous functionalities like photo upload and trip management were preserved. The core of this trajectory then shifted to implementing a chat system between passengers and drivers when a trip is active. The AI designed and implemented this using a polling mechanism, adhering to a 250-character limit, and integrated it into both passenger and driver dashboards. Furthermore, the administrative dashboard was enhanced to include a Chat M/P section, and the backend's  endpoint was modified to provide comprehensive passenger and driver details for better oversight. The AI completed backend changes, created a reusable frontend chat component, and integrated it into both user dashboards. The trajectory concludes with the AI providing the complete modified and new code files to the user for local implementation, confirming backend stability and frontend functionality after resolving a port issue.

<product_requirements>
The Transport App Brasília MVP is a ride-sharing application for Android/iOS, mimicking Uber. It handles user management (passenger, driver, admin registration/login, blocking), trip management (requests, tracking, acceptance, completion), a reporting system, and a 5-star post-trip rating system. Admin features include report viewing, driver alerts, user/trip management, bulk deletion, and direct passenger messaging. Recent updates added profile photo upload for all user types, with admin/driver/passenger dashboards displaying these photos and offering clickable full-screen viewing. The current focus is on implementing a real-time chat system between passengers and drivers once a trip is accepted, utilizing polling for simplicity, and with a 250-character message limit. The admin dashboard must record these chats and display detailed passenger/driver information (photo, name, email, contact) alongside trip routes and statuses for better managerial control.

<code_architecture>

- ****: Central FastAPI application.
    - **Changes Made**: Extended  model with  for admin display. Added  Pydantic model (, , , , ). Implemented new API endpoints:  for sending messages,  for fetching messages, and  modified to fetch and embed full passenger/driver user details (name, email, phone, photo) for each trip.
- ****: Admin control panel.
    - **Changes Made**: A new tab Chat M/P was added to the dashboard. The  component (implicitly, as the backend  was modified) now expects and can display richer user data (photos, names, emails, phones) for passengers and drivers involved in trips.
- ****: Passenger interface.
    - **Changes Made**: Integrated . New states (, , ) for chat functionality. A Chat button was added to the  (next to Report Driver) which triggers the  modal, visible only when a trip is  or .
- ****: Driver interface.
    - **Changes Made**: Initially, the entire file was replaced with a user-provided version. Post-replacement,  was integrated. New states (, , ) were added for chat functionality. A Chat button was added to the  (next to Report Passenger) which triggers the  modal, visible only when a trip is  or .
- ** (New file)**: A reusable React Native component.
    - **Summary of why this file is important**: Encapsulates the chat UI and logic, including message display, input field with character limit, sending messages via API (polling), and auto-scrolling. It's designed to be used by both passenger and driver dashboards.

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate fully with Google Maps API for accurate distance matrix, routing, and real-time map display.
- Implement an advanced payment system (e.g., Stripe, PagSegurop).
- Expand geographical coverage beyond Brasília/DF.
- Add push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).
- Develop detailed KYC and background check processes for drivers.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully implemented the chat system between drivers and passengers and integrated it into their respective dashboards. This included backend API endpoints for sending and retrieving messages (using a polling mechanism) and a reusable  for the frontend. The admin dashboard was also updated to include a Chat M/P tab, and its trip view was enhanced to display comprehensive passenger and driver details for each trip. The AI confirmed the backend was fully operational and validated frontend loading after resolving a port issue. The very last explicit request from the user was to provide the *complete* code for the driver, passenger, and admin dashboards (which have the chat integration), after having already provided separate files for chat-related modifications and the new chat component. The AI was in the process of fulfilling this request by generating the full  and was about to do the same for the driver and admin dashboards.
