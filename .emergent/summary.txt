The previous AI engineer successfully initiated development of a ride-sharing MVP. The initial phase focused on resolving environment setup issues, particularly with MongoDB and Uvicorn on the user's Windows machine, including  and  not recognized, eventually resolving them by suggesting Docker. A critical bug with  not working on web (where the user was testing) led to implementing cross-platform  and  utilities. The AI then implemented a comprehensive reporting and user blocking system across the backend, admin, driver, and passenger dashboards, including specific buttons and response mechanisms. Finally, the AI addressed missing  handlers for quick action buttons in the passenger dashboard. The AI diligently provided complete code snippets upon user request and handled redirects after logout for each user type.

The user initially requested a ride-sharing application, TransportDF, akin to Uber/99, for Brasília/DF, targeting Android and iOS. The MVP's core features included passenger (registration, interactive map, trip request, tracking), driver (registration, online/offline toggle, trip management), and admin (dashboard, user/trip monitoring) functionalities.

Through the trajectory, the user's requests evolved to:
1.  **Backend Setup**: Resolve issues with  and  execution for local development.
2.  **Frontend Accessibility**: Ensure the application's frontend is accessible via web, and separate user type logins (e.g.,  for passengers only).
3.  **Cross-Platform UI**: Fix UI elements (like confirmation alerts and logout actions) to function correctly on both web and mobile platforms.
4.  **Reporting System**: Implement a feature for passengers to report drivers and drivers to report passengers, with a Title, Description, and Send button.
5.  **Admin Management**: On the admin dashboard, reports should be viewable, and the admin should be able to send a message to the reported user, offering a single chance to respond. Admins also need to block/unblock users.
6.  **Logout Redirection**: Ensure logout directs users to their respective login page (e.g., driver to ).
7.  **Passenger Dashboard Quick Actions**: Activate Histórico, Pagamento, and Ajuda buttons in the passenger dashboard with placeholder functionality.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has recently completed implementing a comprehensive reporting and user blocking system across the application. This includes:
1.  **Backend ()**: New API endpoints, models, and enums for creating, fetching, responding to, and managing reports, as well as blocking/unblocking users. The backend logic for  was also debugged.
2.  **Admin Dashboard ()**: A new Reports tab was added, allowing administrators to view all reports, send messages to reported users, resolve/dismiss reports, and block/unblock users. This dashboard also had its logout redirection fixed and  replaced with cross-platform utilities.
3.  **Driver Dashboard ()**: A Reportar Passageiro button was added for active trips, enabling drivers to submit reports. A notification system and a modal for viewing and responding to reports against the driver were implemented. Logout redirection was fixed, and  replaced with cross-platform utilities.
4.  **Passenger Dashboard ()**: A Reportar Motorista button was added for active trips, allowing passengers to submit reports. A notification system and a modal for viewing and responding to reports against the passenger were also implemented. Logout redirection was fixed, and  replaced with cross-platform utilities.
5.  **Platform Compatibility**: All dashboard alert/confirmation dialogs () have been replaced with cross-platform  and  utility functions to ensure functionality on both web and mobile environments.
6.  **Login Separation**: The initial entry point () was refactored to create specific login/registration pages for each user type (, , ), enhancing user experience by directing users to their dedicated access points.
