This trajectory details the evolution of the TransportDF ride-sharing MVP. Initially, the focus was on restoring a stable codebase after a failed renaming attempt. Subsequent work involved enhancing the driver dashboard with real-time rating display and alert acknowledgment. The project then progressed to implementing complex features on the admin dashboard, including bulk deletion for various entities and a system for sending direct messages to passengers. A significant challenge arose with the admin dashboard where the AI repeatedly overwrote existing functionalities while adding profile photo display, necessitating careful re-integration with the original code. Finally, the development shifted to integrating profile photo upload/display and passenger rating into the passenger and driver dashboards, with backend support for photo storage. The trajectory concludes with the AI receiving the original passenger dashboard code to implement photo upload.

<product_requirements>
The application is a ride-sharing MVP for Brasília/DF, Transport App Brasília MVP, on Expo React Native (Android/iOS), similar to Uber.
**Core Features:**
1.  **User Management**: Passenger, driver, admin registration and dedicated logins. User blocking/unblocking.
2.  **Trip Management**: Passenger trip requests and tracking; driver online/offline status, trip acceptance, start, completion.
3.  **Reporting System**: Passengers report drivers, drivers report passengers (title, description); admin views, responds to, resolves/dismisses reports.
4.  **Rating System**: 5-star post-trip rating for drivers by passengers (mandatory reason for < 5 stars, resets every 100 trips). Admin views low ratings and sends alerts to drivers (button disabled if alert sent).
5.  **Admin Alerts**: Drivers view admin alerts, mark as read.
6.  **Passenger Quick Actions**: Placeholder alerts for Histórico, Pagamento, and Ajuda buttons.
7.  **Project Name**: Reverted from SkyCab to Transport App Brasília MVP.

**Implemented Enhancements:**
-   **Driver Dashboard**: Real-time rating display; Ok, entendido button to mark alerts as read.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: Bulk deletion for trips, users (excluding admins), reports, and ratings; Mensagem para Passageiro menu item for direct messaging to passengers.
-   **Passenger Dashboard**: Display user rating; read admin messages with notifications.
-   **Profile Photos**: Allow passenger and driver to upload local photos via clickable avatar; admin dashboard to display photo miniatures and a clickable popup for enlarged viewing.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing profile photo functionalities across the application. The backend () has been updated to support  in the  model, an endpoint for photo upload (), and to include passenger photo/rating in trip details for drivers (). The  library has been installed in the frontend.

On the frontend, the following has been implemented:
-   **Admin Dashboard ()**: The ability to view user profile photo miniatures next to usernames and click them to open an enlarged view in a popup modal. This was a critical re-implementation after a previous version accidentally removed existing functionalities, ensuring all original features are preserved.
-   **Driver Dashboard ()**: Driver's own profile photo upload via a clickable avatar, and the display of the passenger's photo and rating within the trip details.
-   **Passenger Dashboard ()**: Passenger's own profile photo upload via a clickable avatar, alongside the existing rating display and admin message reading functionality.

The backend changes for profile photos have been tested and confirmed to be working. The frontend implementations for the admin and driver dashboards have also been completed and verified via screenshots, though a previous frontend issue with the Messages tab on the admin dashboard was noted. The latest activity involves the user providing the original  file for the AI to adjust for photo upload, indicating that the passenger dashboard photo upload might require further adjustments or confirmation of the complete implementation.
